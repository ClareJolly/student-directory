Student Directory

Week 4 project of the Makers Academy pre-course

Using a lot of basic concepts and practices that will be the base for further development as a web developer.

I am going to build a simple terminal based student directory.

Overview 

The script will be invoked from the command-line and it will only use pure Ruby, that is, there will be no external libraries to use. It will have text-based interface that will not look particularly exciting but it's really important to understand how to build basic things before trying to create sophisticated websites.
